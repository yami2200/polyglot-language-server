# Polyglot Language Server:
[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is a JDK that brings Polyglot capability which allows *"multiple programming languages in a single application while eliminating foreign language call costs"*.

The drawback of developing such applications is that there are no tools for developers to debug or diagnose their polyglot program.

Polyglot Language Server is a prototype which provides diagnostics, type checking & auto-completion for Polyglot's GraalVM programs.
